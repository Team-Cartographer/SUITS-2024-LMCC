XRF Scan (both EVs)
1. Relay arrival at worksite
2. Wait for instructions and go from LMCC
3. Begin scanning rocks in designated search area (see XRF user guide below)
4. Flag any rocks that have a geo composition outside of normal ranges
a. This is a good opportunity to use pin dropping
5. Continue scanning until abnormal sample is collected or given instruction to stop
XRF Scan (MCC)
1. Wait for arrival confirmation from EV
2. Relay search area to EV
a. This will be a portion of the task where pin dropping could be useful, however, you will have a map of the designated search areas included
3. Give EV go to proceed
